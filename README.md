# Shrirang Mahajan - Portfolio
> A Jupyter Notebook-inspired portfolio built with React.js and vanilla CSS

This is my personal portfolio, designed to look and feel like a Jupyter Notebook but built entirely in **React.js** with **vanilla CSS**. It showcases my projects in AI, Machine Learning, and Full Stack, experience.

(P.S. The theme toggle button doesn't work just yet, but the theme will change according to your device's default settings.)
